# Git Workflow and Collaboration Guide

This document provides an overview of common Git operations and best practices for collaboration.

## Tasks Covered

1. Creating a new Git repository locally
2. Managing project files with `git add` and `git commit`
3. Configuring `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files
4. Working with branches (`feature/api`)
5. Merging branches back into `main`
6. Pushing changes to a remote repository on GitHub with descriptive commit messages

## Best Practices

- Use meaningful commit messages for clear project history
- Maintain a consistent `.gitignore` to avoid tracking sensitive or irrelevant files
- Use feature branches for new features or fixes
- Keep the main branch stable and deployable

## Notes

Following these practices ensures a clean, collaborative, and efficient workflow for software development projects.
